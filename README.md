# PeekNow
A modern, full-featured social media mobile application built with React Native (Expo). PeekNow lets users share ephemeral photo updates ("Peeks"), chat with friends, and toggle between light/dark themes—all wrapped in a clean, camera-first interface.
### ✨ Features
 * **📸 Camera & Photo Sharing:** Capture photos directly in-app using expo-camera. After taking a shot, preview it, save to your device gallery, or post it instantly to your feed.
 * **🏠 Feed:** Scroll through Peeks from friends and the community. Each post displays the user's avatar, name, and timestamp overlaid on the image.
 * **💬 Chat & Messaging:** View your chat list with unread indicators and green rings for new Peeks. Open individual chat rooms to send and receive messages with real-time typing support.
 * **🌓 Theme Toggle:** Switch seamlessly between light and dark modes. The entire UI—backgrounds, cards, text, and borders—adapts instantly.
 * **📱 Bottom Navigation:** Quick access to Feed, Chats, Camera, and Profile via a persistent tab bar.
 * **🔔 Smart Indicators:** Unread message badges and "new Peek" rings keep you informed at a glance.

### 🎨 Theming

PeekNow includes a built-in theme system with light and dark modes. Colors are centralized in `constants/colors.js`:

* **Light Mode:** Clean whites and soft grays with blue accents
* **Dark Mode:** Deep blacks and dark grays with the same accent color

The theme is passed via React state and consumed by all screens and components.
